    "text": "Our Lab\nThe Flourishing Lab has been established in Jan, 2023 at University of Canterbury. It consists a team of multidisciplinary researchers from across New Zealand. The aim is to discover and study factors that affect human flourishing, meaning-making, resilience, and wellbeing.\nThe current project of the The Flourishing Lab is A National Longitudinal Study of Muslim Diversity and Flourishing. It is aimed to discover predictors of flourishing and resilience, and exploring diversity in New Zealand Mulsim community by conducting a longitudinal panel study1 in the context of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS).\n\nProject Summary\nNZAVS is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders that started in 2009. It is currently following 38,551 participants, almost 1% of the New Zealand’s adult population. Over 20% of NZAVS survey items were developed with global virtue experts to specifically investigate the interplay of religion, virtue, and flourishing as people age. Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand’s population, less than 0.5% of New Zealand’s Muslims are currently participating in the study (n = 70). The proposed project will build on existing Muslim community partnerships to boost the NZAVS Muslim sample by 2,000 participants, thus enabling to explore Muslim flourishing longitudinally on a national level.\n\n\nThe need this project\nA panel study follows the same individuals over time and is ideal for addressing questions about how life experiences combine with beliefs and circumstances that affect human flourishing. However, because the necessary longitudinal datasets are lacking, little is known about the dynamics of Muslim faith and flourishing. It is important to address this gap in understanding because: (a) religion has long been theorized to play an enabling role in human flourishing, and (b) Islam is a growing religion. As such, the systemic study of Muslim flourishing is among science’s greatest uncharted frontiers. In addition, Muslims have been the targets of stereotyping and prejudice in New Zealand. By capitalizing on NZAVS infrastructure, this project will address an urgent scientific need and clarify the extent of Muslim diversity, mechanisms of resilience, and lines of similarity with other faiths.\nMuch of our work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived. However, we have identified strong signals of Muslim interest in flourishing science: recently, we have talked with 29 Muslims from diverse backgrounds across New Zealand. They had a 100% agreement on conducting research on Muslims self-perception, as well as the scientific study of Muslim flourishing. Therefore, we believe that the proposed project will amplify our community partnerships and foster Muslims’ interest by involving them in longitudinal science.\nThis project will have the most importance to Muslims as explained above. Additionally, it will also be important to the public, and to understanding about Muslims living in the Western countries that share a similar way of life with New Zealand.\nThis project will give us a scientific understanding of Muslim flourishing, thereby, a timely and under-researched connection of religion and flourishing will be explored. The data from this project could also be used by NZAVS researchers who publish on other aspects of life such as health, politics, life satisfaction, etc. This is substantial because due to minute participation of Muslims in the ongoing NZAVS research, we do not have meaningful understanding about these aspects of Muslims in New Zealand. With this project, we have established The Flourishing Lab at University of Canterbury | Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha, that would attract further research and scholarship.\nThe target audience of this project are the Muslim community, academics, science readers, rights advocates, and policy makers. The outputs are a rich longitudinal dataset of 3660 observations, 6 public talks, a seminar for government officials, and six scientific publications.\n\n\nVision\nVision Statement for The Muslim Diversity Study\nThe NZAVS is committed to the following three principles for the Muslim Diversity Study.\n\nProtection: the NZAVS is strongly committed to respecting and protecting data gathered from all participants and takes confidentiality seriously. Our commitment to participant privacy and safety is central to the NZAVS Muslim Diversity Study. For a description of our safety protocols click here.\nParticipation: the NZAVS is committed to enhancing the research capacity of our communities in Aoteoroa New Zealand. Any NZAVS research focusing specifically on the Muslim community will be reviewed by our Muslim academic advisor Dr Usman Afzali, and/or appropriate nominated reviewers from the Muslim community in New Zealand. We are committed to Muslim community-led research for Muslim-focussed studies to ensure respectful reporting that considers the social, religious, and cultural settings of New Zealand’s Muslims.\nPartnership: the NZAVS actively fosters opportunities for collaborative research with emerging Muslim researchers in New Zealand. We seek to mentor Muslim graduate students interested in accessing NZAVS data for research in their own postgraduate theses or dissertations. We invite students from the Muslim community in New Zealand to contact our Muslim academic advisor, or any member of the NZAVS board or leadership team for guidance in developing a project.\n\n\n\nPurpose\nThis website is intended to provide introduction to the the Muslim Flourishing Study. Furthermore, findings, progress reports, publications, and data analysis code will be made available in a timely manner.\n\n\nPrivacy\nWe take privacy extremely seriously. Since the beginning of NZAVS (14 years ago), we have put practices in place that ensure our participants’ identities and personal information are kept strictly confidential. Please read further about our privacy here.\n\n\nGot questions?\nPlease contact Usman Afzali usman.afzali@canterbury.ac.nz"

    "text": "We propose a novel longitudinal study of Muslims in New Zealand. The proposed study will build on the existing capacity of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) infrastructure and will add 2,000 Muslim participants to its longitudinal sample.\nThe purpose of our project is to develop a first-class longitudinal science of Muslim religious diversity in New Zealand that is capable of changing conversations about religion. The challenge to such a conversation-changing science can be expressed simply: data about Muslim flourishing are lacking.\nThis section describes our step-by-step plan for longitudinal data collection from across New Zealand’s diverse Muslim community. Before describing our plan for data collection, we must first describe our partnership with the NZAVS. This background will help to clarify the motivation, interest, and prospects for success of our proposed longitudinal study of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand.\nThe New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a national longitudinal probability study that has been collecting data on New Zealanders’ health, personality, relationships, employment, behaviours, values, beliefs, and community-making annually since 2009.\nBecause the same individuals are measured each year, NZAVS data enable researchers to evaluate causal theories about what makes life good for people and how the good life varies across demographically diverse populations. The NZAVS is notable for having a large sample (currently about 1% of New Zealand’s adult population, recruited randomly). The NZAVS also has a very good annual retention rate of about 80%, which is made possible by the access that qualified researchers in New Zealand have to the government’s electoral roll. Without a capacity for following people as they move and change contact details, retention would be very difficult. The NZAVS questionnaire is made available in both print and online formats [newzeal2023], which further increases the reach of the study into communities that are not familiar with internet technologies.\nIn 2018, 42 new items were added to the NZAVS questionnaire to investigate the causal interplay of humility, gratitude, forgiveness, generosity, and multi-dimensional human flourishing. These items enable researchers to systematically investigate how these virtues are affected by community-making, how community-making affects these virtues, whether the interplay of community-making and virtue affects dimensions of human flourishing, and if so, which are specifically affected. As mentioned, the present project offers an exciting opportunity to extend the NZAVS longitudinal study of human flourishing to the Muslim community in New Zealand, where response rates are ten-fold times lower than they are for other major religious groups. The under-representation of Muslims, then, is the critical challenge to the longitudinal study of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand. Our study will address this mission-critical challenge by collecting new data from across a nationally diverse Muslim community and recruiting participants into the NZAVS.\nThe present project offers an exciting opportunity to extend the NZAVS longitudinal study of human flourishing study to the Muslim community in New Zealand.\nThe NZAVS has many dozens of collaborators from within New Zealand and across the world, who have collectively published over 150 scientific articles. The NZAVS has developed effective relationships with churches, mosques, community leaders, minority communities, business leaders, and the government. Further information regarding NZAVS can be found online [thenew2023a].\nBefore explaining further, it may be helpful to describe some additional context about the Muslim community in New Zealand and our previous research on Muslims in New Zealand. In our previous research, investigating attitudes towards Muslims and minorities, we found that Muslims are among the least accepted groups in New Zealand [shanaah2021; sibley2020b]. Recently, the community suffered White supremacist terrorist attacks on two mosques which killed 51 people. Despite these challenges, our qualitative research indicates that many Muslims in New Zealand are flourishing. To systematically identify the factors that enable Muslim flourishing, however, requires data. The first motivation for this study is to collect such data so that the many untold stories of Muslim flourishing may be recorded and understood. By contrast, without such data, the NZAVS will be limited to investigating how Muslims in New Zealand are perceived [bulbulia2022; shanaah2021; shaver2017; sibley2020b; yogeeswaran2019]. To this end, we have developed a plan that will recruit 2,000 Muslims into NZAVS."

    "section": "What are the barriers to the longitudinal science of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand?",
    "text": "What are the barriers to the longitudinal science of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand?\nOur discussions with the Muslim community suggest three major obstacles to Muslim involvement in longitudinal survey research: 1) a lack of awareness about benefits of longitudinal flourishing science for the Muslim community; 2) a general mistrust of institutions; 3) language barriers.\nIn short, our project will address these three problems by engaging in community outreach and education. These activities will put the longitudinal study of spirituality for Muslims on an equal footing with other religious and secular communities in New Zealand. Additionally, the project researchers have fostered support from Muslim community leaders based on trusting relationships. Such support and relationships are critical for any successful science of Muslim flourishing. Our plan is not merely to collect data, but also to make good on our trusting relationships by sharing our science with the Muslim community, and by engaging the Muslim community as partners in our science.\nIn detail:\nDuring 2022 we have initiated a consultation plan with members of New Zealand Muslim community. Specifically, we have conducted semi-structured interviews/discussions with 29 Muslims, including community leaders, religious scholars, youth activists, and everyday Muslims from across New Zealand. This Advisory Group includes different age groups, and males and females from Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland, New Zealand’s three largest cities. There have been four objectives: 1) To assess the feasibility of the project for Muslims, 2) To assess interest of Muslims in the project, 3) To get feedback on the survey items, and 4) To inquire if translation may be needed. Through all these efforts, we are happy to report that the community response has been positive in three ways: First, all 29 respondents believed that the study was feasible for Muslims and that Muslims will be interested to participate. Second, not only did this Advisory Group believe that the study and our planned measures were important, they have also promised to support us in every possible way. Third, there has been a consensus that a majority of participants will be able to use the English version. Nevertheless, to reach a broader bandwidth of Muslim diversity, we will need to pilot the NZAVS flourishing scales and survey. In addition, we will have competent research assistants at the community’s disposal when required to clarify items."

    "section": "The project goals",
    "text": "The project goals\nWe want to recruit 2,000 Muslims to participate in NZAVS for three years, train a next generation longitudinal researchers, publish excellent scientific articles, and enhance the study’s community impact through collaborative scholarly network and public service community group.\nThe first goal of this project is to recruit New Zealand Muslims for participating in NZAVS for three years, resulting in 3 waves of panel data. In addition to the current NZAVS data, achieving this goal will result in a novel, powerful dataset for investigating the personal and social aspects of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand. The bottom line in any science is high-quality data measured purposefully and accurately for specific questions.\nThe second goal of this project is to continue publishing high-quality scientific research, which has yielded more than 150 publications since 2013. We estimate that the project will produce 6 scientific publications. Moreover, with over a decade’s worth of longitudinal data collected, the NZAVS team is poised to make important contributions to science.\nThe third goal is to facilitate scientific research opportunities for the Muslim community. This will be achieved in two ways. First, we will facilitate Muslim researchers to publish and collaborate with us as leading authors or co-authors of scientific publications. Second, we will train early career Muslim researchers to collect data and conduct longitudinal science.\nThe fourth goal is to bring the Muslim community closer to NZAVS and science. As a result of community talks, one of the religious groups in New Zealand (i.e., Muslims) will come to see how science and religion jointly play a critical role in understanding human flourishing.\nThe fifth goal is to facilitate advocacy for the Muslim community based on our findings. In the past, we used NZAVS findings to influence government policy decisions (click here for details). The findings from current project will be shared with the Muslim community or a regular basis, and will also be made available as infographics, commentaries, and open-access1 research articles from the current website, to provide a one-stop shop for accessing all needed information. In addition, we are planning to share our findings directly with the government organisations in an attempt to influence key decisions and policy for the good of Muslim community.\nWhat if the project does not take place? We perceive a much greater risk from the certain loss of understanding that will arise from inaction, as well as the lost opportunities to cultivate an interest in science among New Zealand’s Muslim communities if this project does not take place.\nAlthough extensive data are lacking in relation to virtues and attitudes in Muslim community, we expect that Muslims will exhibit similar levels of flourishing as members of highly identified non-Muslim denominations, and perhaps somewhat greater levels of flourishing than weakly identified or secular minority migrants. NZAVS data show that perceived religious discrimination is declining only among people with lower levels of religious identification as seen in Figure 1. Among those with higher levels of religious identification, perceived religious discrimination remains high. We expect Muslims to exhibit perceived religious discrimination at levels comparable to highly religious non-Muslims. Indeed, this is what the NZAVS observes in its current, small Muslim sample (Figure 2). The NZAVS also finds that Muslims perceive religion to be a social good, at levels similar to smaller Christian denominations (Figure 3). We expect this study to clarify the grounds of these judgments.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Dicrimination by identification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Discrimination by religion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Religion as social good"

However, we will be trying to test the following hypotheses immediately – within the span of the proposed project:\nHypothesis 1: Muslims with the strongest ties to their community as measured by service attendance and prayer are buffered most from anti-Muslim prejudice.\nHypothesis 2: Muslims experience greater challenges to employment and health than matched members of other religious groups.\nHypothesis 3: Subjective well-being, the meaning of life, and psychological distress are similar among Muslims and matched members of religious groups from the buffering of religious community-making."

This gives us a methodological safety-net since we can be more confident that the meaning of concepts is not distorted because of translation. As far as the translation itself is concerned, we have consulted with a group (Sulaiman-Hill and colleagues) who have been conducting research within the Muslim community. Therefore, instead of translating the questionnaire, we will recruit research assistants, train them on survey items, and keep them at the Muslim community’s disposal when needed. In addition, the questionnaire will be piloted within the community before being rolled out to the whole community.\nProcedure (data collection): We will achieve our goal of data collection by reaching out to the many community organizations and researchers. Specifically, the PI (Usman Afzali) has already consulted with and gained support for this initiative through numerous Muslim community and social organizations.\nWe will further consult with the community leadership and researchers. Following this, we will recruit 10 paid research assistants from the Muslim community to assist with data collection, and pilot the questionnaires. With the help from community organizations and researchers, we will then deliver three inaugural talks in the three largest cities of New Zealand (Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington), followed by data collection from 2,000 participants. The temporal gap between Wave 1 of data collection and Wave 2 will be used to write a method article and two science papers. We will collect Wave 2 in the second year followed by three community talks in three large cities (Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington) based on our findings. After Wave 3 (the third year of data collection), we will work on mechanisms to ensure continuous participation from the Muslim community within the NZAVS framework. During the third year, we will also submit three papers for publication and deliver seminars to inform the authorities and policy makers within different ministries and government organisations."

It is conducted as part of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study.\n\nAbout NZAVS\nNZAVS is a large longitudinal national probability annual panel study1 of social attitudes, personality, ideology and health outcomes. The NZAVS began in 2009 and is curated by Professor Chris Sibley. It includes questionnaire responses from more than 70,000 New Zealand residents. The study includes researchers from many New Zealand universities, including the University of Auckland, Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Canterbury, the University of Otago, and Waikato University. Because the survey asks the same people to respond each year, it can track subtle change in attitudes and values over time, and is an important resource for researchers both in New Zealand and around the world. The NZAVS is university-based, not-for-profit and independent of political or corporate funding.\n\n\nWhy the Muslim Diversity Study?\nAs a committed member of the New Zealand Muslim community, the lead researcher of the Muslim Diversity Study, Dr Usman Afzali recognised the importance of including Muslim voices in discussions about New Zealand. This inspired him to develop a booster study to enhance Muslim representation in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, since Muslims are underrepresented at present. By capitalizing on NZAVS infrastructure, this project aims clarify the extent of Muslim diversity, mechanisms of resilience, and lines of similarity with other faiths.\nMuch of the NZAVS work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived.

I completed my PhD in psychology and am currently the principal investigator (lead researcher) of the three-year Muslim Diversity Study (since the beginning of 2023). Beside research, I teach psychology at University of Canterbury. I migrated to New Zealand in 2011 and have been living in Christchurch since. In the past few years, I have published several articles with New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) focusing on Muslim perception and attitudes toward Muslims in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsman Afzali, PhD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I do this research?\nAs a researcher and committed member of the New Zealand Muslim community, I recognise the importance of including our voices in discussions about New Zealand. This inspired me to develop a booster study to enhance Muslim representation in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, since we are underrepresented at present. This limits the inferences we can make about how Muslims diversity, perception, flourishing, resilience, and meaning-making.\n\n\n\n\nWe are recruiting Muslim collaborators and Muslim research assistants from the community - which will not only help us work together with Muslim scholars, but also train a new cohort of Muslim researchers who might lead further Muslim-focused research, and help bring Muslims of New Zealand closer to science. This is what excites me, and this is why this project is so close to my heart.\n\n\n\nMore about me: Academic website, Instiution Homepage"

    "text": "Why we need ethics approval?\nEthical approval for research is essential to ensure that studies involving human participants are conducted in a morally responsible and respectful manner. It serves to protect the rights, wellbeing, dignity, and confidentiality of those involved in the research, as well as the broader community affected by the study. Ethical approval ensures that potential risks are minimized, benefits are maximized, informed consent is obtained, and any potential conflicts of interest or biases are addressed. This oversight helps maintain public trust in the scientific community and upholds the fundamental principles of fairness, respect, and accountability in research endeavors."
