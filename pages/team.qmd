Our team consists of a junior researcher and many senior academics affiliated with public universities of New Zealand (University of Canterbury, Victoria University of Wellington, and The University of Auckland). We come from different backgrounds, we are politically unaffiliated and we do not represent or work for any community, religious, or political organisations. Our main motivation is to conduct good science and share it with the New Zealand public and scientific community. 

Our current project is the first instance after establishing [The Flourishing Lab](https://usman-afzali.github.io/muslim-flourishing-nz/intro.html#the-flourishing-lab), whose members are introduced as follows.

## The Flourishing Lab Team Members

### Principal Investigator - Postdoctoral Research Fellow

::: {layout="[[70, 30], [100]]"}
Hello/Salaam/Kia ora. I am Usman Afzali - a postdoctoral research fellow
at University of Canterbury. I completed my PhD in psychology and am
currently the principal investigator of the three-year Muslim
Flourishing Project (since the beginning of 2023). Beside research, I also teach psychology at University of Canterbury.
I migrated to New Zealand in 2011 and have been living in Christchurch
since. In the past few years, I have published several articles with [New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study](https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/new-zealand-attitudes-and-values-study.html) (NZAVS) focusing on Muslim perception and attitudes toward Muslims in New Zealand.

#### Why I do this research?

I noted that NZAVS did not have many Muslim participants - which limits
the inferences we can make about how Muslims perceive themselves in New
Zealand, what makes Muslims resilient and flourish despite
atrocities, and what factors contribute to meaning-making in Muslims. This is why the current project was conceived. Our aim is to
collect longitudinal data from Muslims of New Zealand and publish our
findings in peer-reviewed Open Science scientific journals[^1]. These
outputs will provide an objective account of Muslims' social attitudes
and values in New Zealand, and will allow Muslims to use these findings
to advocate for their rights. In addition, such findings could be used to inform and influence government policy in relation to Muslim rights, and minority rights in general. Finally, our findings could also be used in other Muslim minority countries to spread awareness.

We are recruiting Muslim collaborators and Muslim research assistants from the community - which
will not only help us work together with Muslim scholars, but also train a new cohort of Muslim researchers who might lead further Muslim-focused research, and
help bring Muslims of New Zealand closer to science. This is what excites me, and this is why this project is so close to my heart.
