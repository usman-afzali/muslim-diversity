Our team consists of a junior researcher and many senior academics affiliated with public universities of New Zealand (University of Canterbury, Victoria University of Wellington, and The University of Auckland). We come from different backgrounds, we are politically unaffiliated, and we do not represent or work for any community, religious, or political organisations. Our main motivation is to conduct good science and share it with the New Zealand public and scientific community. 


## Team Members

### Lead Researcher

::: {layout="[[70, 30], [100]]"}
I am Usman Afzali - a postdoctoral research fellow
at University of Canterbury. I completed my PhD in psychology and am
currently the principal investigator (lead researcher) of the three-year Muslim
Diversity Study (since the beginning of 2023). Beside research, I teach psychology at University of Canterbury.
I migrated to New Zealand in 2011 and have been living in Christchurch
since. In the past few years, I have published several articles with [New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study](https://osf.io/75snb/) (NZAVS) focusing on Muslim perception and attitudes toward Muslims in New Zealand.

#### Why I do this research?

As a researcher and committed member of the New Zealand Muslim community, I recognise the importance of including our voices in discussions about New Zealand. This inspired me to develop a booster study to enhance Muslim representation in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, since we are underrepresented at present. This limits the inferences we can make about how Muslims diversity, perception, flourishing, resilience, and meaning-making.

We are recruiting Muslim collaborators and Muslim research assistants from the community - which
will not only help us work together with Muslim scholars, but also train a new cohort of Muslim researchers who might lead further Muslim-focused research, and
help bring Muslims of New Zealand closer to science. This is what excites me, and this is why this project is so close to my heart.
